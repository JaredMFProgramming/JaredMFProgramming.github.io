# Preface
Welcome to the official website for Studio MF Technologies, the software development studio that's coming to you in the future.  Once I graduate college, not only will I create video games, I will also create crazy applications!
## About Me
My name is Jared Newsom, but you can call me Jared Michael Funtime (Jared M.F. for short).  I am autistic, like to code, compose music, and draw (but most of all, I like to code).  I am currently following my mind's goal of developing a true indie game.  I also like cats, so like GitHub's mascot, mine will be cat.  I like dank memes, too!
# Downloads
Here, I post all my finished products of epicness.  So many to choose from, but more will come soon!
